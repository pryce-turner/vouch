# Vouch: A Decentralized Endorsement Network
Vouch is a framework for building a network of real people. Built on Ethereum, Vouch allows users to affirm each other’s identities through reciprocal investment in a special fund. The bigger this “identity fund”, the more likely a real person is responsible for the account. A voting system, inspired by game theory, is used to discredit potentially fake accounts.

## Built With: 
* [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) - the IDE
* [TestRPC](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) - simulated blockchain for testing
